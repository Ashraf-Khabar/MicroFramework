MicripFramework
===============

MicripFramework is a C# DLL that provides a lightweight framework for working with models and database connections.

Features
--------

-   Model class for defining data models
-   Connection class for managing database connections using an XML environment document
-   Support for common database operations such as querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data
-   Data validation, serialization, and deserialization functionalities
-   Easy configuration and customization through the XML environment document

Usage
-----

1.  Add the MicripFramework DLL as a reference to your C# project.

2.  Define your data models by inheriting from the Model class and specifying the properties and validation rules for your data objects.

    csharpCopy code

    ```
    class MyModel : Model
    {
        public string Name { get; set; }
        public int Age { get; set; }
    }
    ```

3.  Create an XML environment document to configure your database connection information. The document should follow the provided schema, which includes elements for specifying the database type, connection string, and other settings.

    xmlCopy code

    ````xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <ConnectionSettings>
        <DatabaseType>SqlServer</DatabaseType>
        <ConnectionString>Data Source=.;Initial Catalog=myDatabase;Integrated Security=True</ConnectionString>
    </ConnectionSettings>
    ```

4.  Initialize the Connection class with the path to your XML environment document and use it to establish and manage database connections.

    csharpCopy code

    ```
    var connection = new Connection("path/to/environment.xml");
    connection.Open();
    // Perform database operations using the connection object
    connection.Close();
    ```
